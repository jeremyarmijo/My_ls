# My_ls

## Introduction

`my_ls` is a personal project to recreate a simplified version of the Unix `ls` command as part of my studies at Epitech. This project enhances my understanding of file system navigation, manipulation, and C programming.

## Features

- List files and directories in the current directory.
- Display detailed information about files.
- Handle command-line options (`-l`, `-a`, `-d`).

## Installation

Clone the repository and compile the program:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeremyarmijo/My_ls.git
cd my_ls
make
```

## Usage

Run the command with options to customize output:

```bash
./my_ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```
